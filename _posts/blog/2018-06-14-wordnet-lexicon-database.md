[Wordnet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/), what is this? It's nothing short of a great lexical database in English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms, each expressing a distinct concept. The framework makes it a useful tool for computational linguistics and natural language processing.

Wordnet superficially resembles a synonym dictionary, for it groups words based on their meanings. However, there are some important distinctions. It interconnects not only word forms - sequences of letters - but specific meanings of words. As a result, words that are close to each other on the network are semantically unambiguous. Another point is the labeling of semantic relations between words, while word grouping does not follow any explicit pattern beyond the similarity of meaning.
